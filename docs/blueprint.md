## Style Guidelines:

- Predominantly black (#000000) for a dramatic, high-contrast canvas, with subtle gradient transitions to beige (#F5F5DC) in lighter sections for visual breaks and depth.
- White (#FFFFFF) for all text, UI elements, and borders to ensure crisp readability and Swiss-style clarity on dark backgrounds.
- Vibrant reddish-orange (#FF4500) for interactive elements (links, buttons, highlights, badges) to convey energy and disruption, mirroring the reference's bold red text.
- 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif (or fallback to Helvetica Neue) for massive, bold, all-caps headlines with staggered positioning and letter-spacing for graphic impact.
- 'Inter' sans-serif for body text, descriptions, and labels, with variable weights for hierarchy â€“ ensuring legibility at 16-18px base size.
- Ultra-minimalist icons (e.g., thin lines/dots from Heroicons) for vertical fixed nav bar on left (indicating sections with color shifts to #FF4500 on active). Add subtle glow/shadow on hover for micro-interactions.
- Single-page vertical scrolling with full-screen snapping sections (using CSS Scroll Snap). Incorporate parallax for backgrounds and elements. Ensure responsive grids with generous negative space.
- Scroll-triggered parallax; micro-interactions (glow/scales on hovers, loading spinners); macro transitions (smooth fades/slides between sections with easing); text reveals; image masking. Optimize for performance and accessibility.
